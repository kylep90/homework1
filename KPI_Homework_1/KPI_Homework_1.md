Homework 1 - Kyle Pingue Due date 28.03.2020

What the project asked of me?

The project asked me to reformat a html and css file in order
for it to be user friendly and 'clean'. To do this I:
    1) Used semantic HTLM elements - (removed all <div> and <span> elements)
    2) Improved the layout of the code - by adding indents and spaces
    3) Added attributes to the image elements
    4) Added a title
    5) And restructured the codes in a logical order.

Here are some of the main changes that I made. The lines refer to the lines in the original code.

HTML file
Line 7 - Added a title
Line 11, 13, 27, 28, 51, 74 - Changed the <div> to elements such as header, nav, image, main, side and footer.
Line 12 - Changed the <span> to <h1>
Line 29, 36, 43 - Changes class content to .style-main in order to group classes that used the same style in the 'main' elements
Line 30, 37, 44 54, 61, 68 - Added attributes to the images (is there a correct way in doing this??)
Line 52, 59, 66 - Changed the content to .style-aside in oder to group classes that used the same style in the 'aside' elements
Line 68 - Removed the </img> tag as <img> is self-closing
Line 74 - Removed class footer as this I can style the whole element without a class.

CSS file
Line 11, 18, 23, 27, 35 - Removed the class .header and created only a element header
Line 53 - Changed to .main-image
The rest will not correspond to certain lines as I have grouped original classes together as I have described above and deleted classes that
were not needed. I also restructered the code, inorder for it to flow logically.

I did have a few questions:
1) About the title element - if I needed to add a description to the title - if so what information needs to be given?
2) I wanted to define the image element in line 27 of the HTML in the HTML and not the CSS. Are you able to do that? And if so would that be
better than defining it in the css?

Extra note - I original removed the id's (line 29, 36, 43) as I couldn't see any reference to them in the css file. However just before submitting this work, I realsied that these id's were referenced in the html file and these are used to 'jump' to reference points on the page. 

Please let me know should you have any questions about my code.
